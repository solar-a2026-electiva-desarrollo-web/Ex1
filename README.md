# Solar-A2026 Electiva Desarrollo Web
  
We believe web development should go beyond just building apps — it should help people understand the digital world they live in. Our projects focus on education, social awareness, and responsible technology use, especially in areas like artificial intelligence and its environmental impact.

Using modern technologies such as Spring Boot, React.js, and Next.js, we aim to design platforms that are not only functional, but also meaningful and socially conscious.

We are here to learn, build useful tools, and grow as developers while keeping ethics and impact in mind.

# About Us

Solar-A2026 is a student-driven web development initiative focused on building meaningful, socially responsible, and educational technology using modern fullstack tools.

# Project Ideas

## > AI Impact & Awareness Dashboard

An educational web platform that explains how artificial intelligence works behind the scenes, including its energy consumption, environmental cost, and responsible usage practices.
It would feature interactive visualizations, comparisons, and practical tips to help users understand when AI is useful — and when it might be unnecessary.

Goal: Promote conscious and informed use of AI technology.

## > Digital Responsibility Learning Hub

A web-based educational portal that teaches digital literacy topics such as data privacy, ethical technology use, algorithm bias, and sustainable computing.
The platform would include short lessons, interactive modules, and quizzes designed for students and everyday internet users.

Goal: Make people more aware, critical, and responsible digital citizens.

## > Community Resource & Initiative Map

A web application where users can explore and share local initiatives related to sustainability, education, and social impact.
It could include a map interface, project descriptions, and ways to participate or contribute.

Goal: Connect people with real-world actions that create positive social and environmental change.
